# DUNGEON MOBS

Hello, folks. Been quite awhile since this mod was updated, and - at this point in my life - I think it's time to admit that I'm not coming back to it.

Don't get me wrong, it was fun while it lasted. The modding community in Minecraft, though, is... difficult, at the best of times, and trying to keep up with all the madness that was Forge back in the day was tiring.

Some have lamented the lapse of this mod from the community, and I know that nothing could ever quite take its place: there are some who tried, and I'm sure they were successful in their own way. But *Dungeon Mobs* was special, in that I had a very specific philosophy and very specific design approach in mind, throughout the entirety of the mod. Other monster mods had - and still perhaps to this day, retain - a sort of weird thing about adding in a bunch of superfluous nonsense, items and pets and dimensions and... ugh. 

The engineer knows his work is done not when there is nothing left to add, but nothing left to take away. I was very cautious about what mobs I added, and even kept a list of future plans: alas, it is likely now that few of those will ever see fruition, if any.

And so, here is my final gift to the Minecraft community: what was to be Dungeon Mobs v4.2.0, which includes the beamos monster, which was teased a few years ago. I never did get it working properly, but I don't want to go through all the noise with Forge and such of getting a Java development environment for Minecraft set up on this machine, so... you'll have to slog through it. Should be fairly simple to at least comment it out, if you know what you're doing: or, if you're feeling real gutsy, go ahead and try to figure out how to make it work (pro tip: don't attempt to work out whether or not the beamos is looking at a player based on its rotation angle, there's a client/server divide there, which is what eventually made me give up on this incarnation of the beamos on a HD that crashed).

Well... there it is, then. It's been a fun ride, and maybe someone out there will pick this up and run with it.

So long, and thanks for all the fish.
